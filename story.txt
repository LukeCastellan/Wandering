The planet used to be a city world many many eons ago, but sometime in the [DATA LOST] century, a massive devastating galactic war occured with an extragalactic invading species of incredible strength. In order to end the war, [$hyperspace] had to be destroyed, therefore fragmenting and dissolving the [$federation]. By the current time, every city planet has collapsed into ruins. But wait, there's more! Alternate technology has been developed before this city planet collapsed: Teleportation!
